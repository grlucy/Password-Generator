# Password-Generator

## Description

This is the site I made for the University of Richmond Bootcamp Homework #3: Password Generator assignment. I used HTML, Git, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript to develop an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. I made this site fully responsive through the use of Bootstrap and media queries. It is deployed on Github Pages at: https://grlucy.github.io/Password-Generator/

This web browser application is intended for use by individuals and organizations that handle large amounts of sensitive data who need to generate strong, customized passwords quickly. It saves the user time and ensures that their password is truly random and secure.

In building this password generator, I learned a lot about Javascript objects, functions, and events. I also learned how to traverse and manipulate the DOM to create interactive and dynamic applications.

## Usage

The user is asked to specify a password length and what types of characters to include via a form. When the form is submitted, it is validated and the user will receive alerts if there are errors. If there are no form errors, the generated password will appear on screen and the user will be able to click a button to copy the password to their clipboard.
